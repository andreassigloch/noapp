# Agent Collaboration Context

## System Under Analysis
- Type: Industrial Coffee Machine
- Phase: Requirements & Risk Analysis
- Goal: Complete system specification with safety validation

## Previous Agent Outputs
This file will be updated as agents complete their analysis.

## Collaboration Protocol
1. Discovery Agent identifies requirements
2. Test Agent challenges and validates
3. Safety Agent performs risk assessment
4. Agents iterate based on findings

## Discovery Agent Output: Complete âœ“
## Test Agent Feedback: 3 gaps identified, 2 requirements challenged
## System Architect Output: Complete architecture with interfaces and dependencies
## Safety Agent Output: 3 critical risks, 5 safety requirements added
