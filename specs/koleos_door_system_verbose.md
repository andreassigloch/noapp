**Vehicle Type:** Mid-size SUV  
**System:** Electronic Door Locking and Access Control System  
**Documentation Source:** Official Renault Owner's Manual Analysis

## Use Case 001: Remote Lock via RENAULT Card

**Use Case ID:** UC-001  
**Use Case Name:** Remote Vehicle Locking using RENAULT Card  
**Primary Actor:** Vehicle Owner  
**Secondary Actors:** Vehicle Security System, Central Locking Module  
**Stakeholders:** Vehicle Owner (security), Insurance Companies (theft prevention)  

**Trigger Event:** Vehicle owner presses the lock button on RENAULT card  
**Trigger Type:** External user action  

**Preconditions:**  
- RENAULT card battery is functional and has sufficient charge  
- Vehicle is within communication range (approximately 2-3 meters)  
- All doors and tailgate are properly closed and latched  
- Vehicle electrical system is operational  
- RENAULT card is synchronized with vehicle security system  

**Main Success Scenario:**  
1. Vehicle owner presses lock button (button 2 or 3) on RENAULT card
2. RENAULT card transmits encrypted locking signal to vehicle receiver
3. Vehicle security system validates signal authentication and card identity  
4. Central locking module activates all door lock actuators simultaneously
5. Vehicle security system activates alarm system and immobilizer
6. Hazard warning lights flash twice to provide visual confirmation of successful locking
7. Vehicle enters secured state with all access points locked

**Postconditions:**  
- All doors, tailgate, and fuel filler flap are locked and secured  
- Vehicle security system is armed and monitoring for intrusion attempts  
- Hazard lights have provided confirmation feedback to user  
- Vehicle is protected against unauthorized access  

**Alternative Flows:**  
- **1a. Door or Tailgate Open:** If any door or tailgate is not properly closed, system displays warning message "Boot open" or "Door open", partial locking occurs with open elements excluded, hazard lights flash once to indicate partial lock status
- **1b. RENAULT Card Battery Low:** System detects weak signal, may still function but displays low battery warning on dashboard, user should replace card battery soon  
- **1c. Signal Interference:** If radio frequency interference prevents signal reception, user must move closer to vehicle and retry, alternative is manual key operation
- **1d. Card Not Recognized:** If card is not synchronized or damaged, system ignores command, no visual feedback provided, user must use backup key method

**Exception Flows:**  
- **E1. System Malfunction:** If central locking module fails, individual door locks may still function manually, user should contact authorized service center  
- **E2. Electrical System Failure:** If vehicle battery is completely discharged, remote locking is not possible, manual key lock remains available

**Business Rules:**  
- Only one RENAULT card can command vehicle at a time  
- Locking command has priority over unlocking if both received simultaneously  
- System must prevent locking when any occupant is detected inside vehicle  

**Quality Requirements:**  
- Signal range must be consistent within specified operating parameters  
- Response time from button press to lock activation must be under 2 seconds  
- Visual feedback must be clearly visible in daylight and darkness conditions  
- Security encryption must meet automotive industry standards  

## Use Case 002: Hands-Free Locking

**Use Case ID:** UC-002  
**Use Case Name:** Automatic Vehicle Locking via Proximity Detection  
**Primary Actor:** Vehicle Owner  
**Secondary Actors:** Proximity Detection System, Security Module  
**Stakeholders:** Vehicle Owner (convenience), Technology Users (automation preference)  

**Trigger Event:** Vehicle owner moves away from vehicle while carrying RENAULT card  
**Trigger Type:** Automatic system detection  

**Preconditions:**  
- RENAULT card is in hands-free mode (activated)  
- Vehicle owner has RENAULT card in possession  
- All doors and tailgate are properly closed  
- Vehicle is in parked state with engine off  
- Proximity sensors are functional and unobstructed  

**Main Success Scenario:**  
1. Vehicle proximity detection system continuously monitors for RENAULT card presence
2. System detects RENAULT card moving outside of access zone (zone 1, approximately 1.5 meters)
3. System verifies all doors and tailgate are properly closed and latched  
4. Proximity system confirms no additional RENAULT cards remain inside vehicle
5. Central locking system activates all door lock mechanisms automatically  
6. Vehicle security system arms itself and begins monitoring for intrusion
7. Visual confirmation provided through brief hazard light activation

**Postconditions:**  
- Vehicle is locked and secured without manual user intervention  
- Hands-free mode remains active for next approach  
- Security system is armed and protecting vehicle  
- User can walk away with confidence that vehicle is secured  

**Alternative Flows:**  
- **2a. Door Handle Touched During Locking:** If user touches door handle during auto-lock sequence, system cancels locking operation, brief delay before retry, user must move completely away for auto-lock to function
- **2b. Multiple Cards Present:** If system detects additional RENAULT cards in vicinity, system delays auto-lock until card positions are clearly determined, prevents locking with card inside vehicle
- **2c. Obstruction Detected:** If door or tailgate not fully closed, system does not auto-lock, provides warning signal, user must ensure proper closure

**Exception Flows:**  
- **E1. Sensor Malfunction:** If proximity sensors fail, hands-free locking is disabled, system reverts to manual locking operation only, service indication displayed
- **E2. Environmental Interference:** Strong electromagnetic fields may affect proximity detection, system may become unreliable in such conditions

**Quality Requirements:**  
- Proximity detection must be accurate within Â±10cm of specified zones  
- System must distinguish between intentional departure and temporary movement  
- Auto-lock delay should be 2-3 seconds to prevent accidental activation
